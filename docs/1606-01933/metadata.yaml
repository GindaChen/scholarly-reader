  We propose a simple neural architecture for natural language inference.

  Our approach uses attention to decompose the problem into subproblems that can be solved
  separately, thus making it trivially parallelizable.

  On the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, we obtain state-of-the-art results with
  almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters than previous work and without relying on any
  word-order information.

  Adding intra-sentence attention that takes a minimum amount of order in
