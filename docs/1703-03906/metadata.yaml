  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has shown remarkable progress over the 
      past few years with production systems now being deployed 
      to end-users. One major drawback of current architectures
      is that they are expensive to train, typically requiring days to weeks of GPU
      time to converge. This makes exhaustive hyperparameter search,
      as is commonly done with other neural network architectures, prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present the first large-scale analysis of
