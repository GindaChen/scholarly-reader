  In this paper we compare different types of recurrent units in recurrent
  neural networks (RNNs). Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that
  implement a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit
  and a recently proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these
  recurrent units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal
  modeling. Our experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are
  indeed better than more traditional recurrent units s
