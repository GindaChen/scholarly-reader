  The prevalent approach to sequence to sequence learning maps an input sequence
  to a variable length output sequence via recurrent neural networks. We
  introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks.
  Compared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully
  parallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of
  non-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated
  linear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a
  separate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup
  of Wu et al. (2016) on both WMT'14 English-German and WMT'14 English-French
  translation at an order of magnitude faster speed, both on GPU and CPU.
