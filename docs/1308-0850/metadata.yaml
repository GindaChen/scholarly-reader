abstract: "This paper shows how Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural networks can be used to generate complex sequences with long-range structure, simply by predicting one data point at a time. \r\nThe approach is demonstrated for text (where the data are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are real-valued). \r\nIt is then extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the network to condition its predictions on a text sequence. \r\nThe resulting system is able to generate highly realistic cursive"
