  The authors of \cite{Cho2014a} have shown that the recently introduced
      neural network translation systems suffer from a significant drop in
      translation quality when translating long sentences, unlike existing
      phrase-based translation systems. In this paper, we propose a way to
      address this issue by automatically segmenting an input sentence into
      phrases that can be easily translated by the neural network translation
      model. Once each segment has been independently translat
