  Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art
  computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks.
  Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become
  mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks.
  Although increased model size and computational cost tend to
  translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough
  labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and
  low parameter count are still enabling factors for vario
