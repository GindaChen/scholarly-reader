  The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters. 
  Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been
  proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional
  increase in computation.  In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance
  challenges.  In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of
  conditional computation, ac
