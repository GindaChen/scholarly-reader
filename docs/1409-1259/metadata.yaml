  Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical
      machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine
      translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder
      extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input
      sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this
      representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the
      neural machine translation using two models; RNN
