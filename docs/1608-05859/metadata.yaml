  We study the topmost weight matrix of neural network language models. We show that this matrix
  constitutes a valid word embedding. When training language models, we recommend tying the input
  embedding and this output embedding. We analyze the resulting update rules and show that the tied
  embedding evolves in a more similar way to the output embedding than to the input embedding in the
  untied model. We also offer a new method of regularizing the output embedding. Our methods lead to
