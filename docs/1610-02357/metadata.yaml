  We present an interpretation of Inception modules in convolutional neural networks as being an
  intermediate step in-between regular convolution and the \textit{depthwise separable convolution}
  operation (a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise convolution). In this light, a
  depthwise separable convolution can be understood as an Inception module with a maximally large
  number of towers. This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network
  architecture inspired by
