  Neural machine translation (NMT) aims at solving machine translation (MT) \mbox{problems} using
  neural networks and has exhibited
    promising results in recent years.  \mbox{However}, most of the existing NMT models are shallow and there is still a performance gap
    between a \mbox{single} NMT model and the best \mbox{conventional} MT system.   In this work, we introduce a new type of linear
    connections, named fast-forward connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (\mbox{LSTM}) network
