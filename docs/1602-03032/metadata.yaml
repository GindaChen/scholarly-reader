  We investigate a new method to augment recurrent neural networks with extra memory without
  increasing the number of network parameters.

  The system has an associative memory based on complex-valued vectors and is closely related to
  Holographic Reduced Representations and Long Short-Term Memory networks. Holographic Reduced
  Representations have limited capacity: as they store more information, each retrieval becomes
  noisier due to interference. 

  Our system in contrast creates redundant copies of s
