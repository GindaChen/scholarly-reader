abstract: |-
  Learning an algorithm from examples is a fundamental problem that has been widely studied.
  It has been addressed using neural networks too, in particular by Neural Turing Machines (NTMs).
  These are fully differentiable computers that use backpropagation to learn their own programming.
  Despite their appeal NTMs have a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature:
  they are not parallel and are are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded.

  We present a neural network architecture
