  Deep convolutional neural networks have recently achieved
    state-of-the-art performance on a number of image recognition benchmarks,
    including the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
    (ILSVRC-2012).  The winning model on the localization sub-task was a network
    that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence score for each object
    category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image context around
    the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same obj
