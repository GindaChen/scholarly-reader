abstract: |-
  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for
  automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses
  of conventional phrase-based translation systems.
  Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in
  training and in translation inference --
  sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models.
  Several authors have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness,
  particularly when input sentences
