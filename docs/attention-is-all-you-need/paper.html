<p>The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that
    include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an
    attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the <strong>Transformer</strong>, based solely on
    attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation
    tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less
    time to train. Our model achieves <strong>28.4 BLEU</strong> on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task,
    improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French
    translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of <strong>41.8</strong>
    after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the
    literature.<sup class="ref-badge" data-ref="1" data-title="Attention Is All You Need"

<p>Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning
    the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states <span class="var"
        data-var="h_t" data-desc="Hidden state at time step t in the recurrent model"

        data-desc="Time step / position index in the sequence" style="--var-color: #58a6ff">t</span>. This inherently
    sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence
    lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.</p>

<p>Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various
    tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences<sup

    cases, however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.</p>

<p>In this work we propose the <strong>Transformer</strong>, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
    relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer
    allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after
    being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.</p>

        data-quote="We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks.">11</sup>, all of
    which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for
    all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two
    arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and
    logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions. In the
    Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution
    due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in
    Section 3.2.</p>

<p>Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention, is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single
    sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a
    variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning
    task-independent sentence representations<sup class="ref-badge" data-ref="12"
        data-title="A Decomposable Attention Model for Natural Language Inference"

        data-quote="We propose a simple neural architecture for natural language inference.">12</sup>.</p>

<p>To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on
    self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or
    convolution.</p>

<h2 id="model-architecture">3 Model Architecture</h2>

<p>Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure. Here, the encoder maps an
    input sequence of symbol representations (<span class="var" data-var="x"
        data-desc="Input symbol representation at each position" style="--var-color: #f0a050">x<sub>1</sub></span>, …,
    <span class="var" data-var="x" data-desc="Input symbol representation at each position"
        style="--var-color: #f0a050">x<sub>n</sub></span>) to a sequence of continuous representations
    <strong>z</strong> = (<span class="var" data-var="z"
        data-desc="Continuous representation output by the encoder at each position"
        style="--var-color: #7ee787">z<sub>1</sub></span>, …, <span class="var" data-var="z"
        data-desc="Continuous representation output by the encoder at each position"
        style="--var-color: #7ee787">z<sub>n</sub></span>). Given <strong>z</strong>, the decoder then generates an
    output sequence (<span class="var" data-var="y" data-desc="Output symbol generated by the decoder at each position"
        style="--var-color: #d2a8ff">y<sub>1</sub></span>, …, <span class="var" data-var="y"
        data-desc="Output symbol generated by the decoder at each position"
        style="--var-color: #d2a8ff">y<sub>m</sub></span>) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is
    auto-regressive, consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.</p>

<p>The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers
    for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="encoder-decoder-stacks">3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks</h3>

<p><strong>Encoder:</strong> The encoder is composed of a stack of <span class="var" data-var="N"
        data-desc="Number of identical layers in the encoder/decoder stack (N = 6)"
        style="--var-color: #ff7b72">N</span> = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a
    multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.
    We employ a residual connection around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. That is, the
    output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(<span class="var" data-var="x"
        data-desc="Input symbol representation at each position" style="--var-color: #f0a050">x</span> + Sublayer(<span
        class="var" data-var="x" data-desc="Input symbol representation at each position"
        style="--var-color: #f0a050">x</span>)), where Sublayer(<span class="var" data-var="x"
        data-desc="Input symbol representation at each position" style="--var-color: #f0a050">x</span>) is the function
    implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well
    as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension <span class="var" data-var="d_model"
        data-desc="Model embedding dimension (d_model = 512)" style="--var-color: #ffd700">d<sub>model</sub></span> =
    512.</p>

<p><strong>Decoder:</strong> The decoder is also composed of a stack of <span class="var" data-var="N"
        data-desc="Number of identical layers in the encoder/decoder stack (N = 6)"
        style="--var-color: #ff7b72">N</span> = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder
    layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder
    stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer
    normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending
    to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position,
    ensures that the predictions for position <span class="var" data-var="i" data-desc="Position index in the sequence"
        style="--var-color: #58a6ff">i</span> can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than <span
        class="var" data-var="i" data-desc="Position index in the sequence" style="--var-color: #58a6ff">i</span>.</p>

<h3 id="attention">3.2 Attention</h3>

<p>An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query,
    keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight
    assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.</p>

<h3 id="scaled-dot-product-attention">3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention</h3>

<p>We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention". The input consists of queries and keys of dimension
    <span class="var" data-var="d_k" data-desc="Dimension of key and query vectors (d_k = 64)"
        style="--var-color: #79c0ff">d<sub>k</sub></span>, and values of dimension <span class="var" data-var="d_v"
        data-desc="Dimension of value vectors (d_v = 64)" style="--var-color: #ffa657">d<sub>v</sub></span>. We compute
    the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by <span class="var" data-var="d_k"
        data-desc="Dimension of key and query vectors (d_k = 64)" style="--var-color: #79c0ff">√d<sub>k</sub></span>,
    and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.</p>

    (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of

        data-desc="Dimension of key and query vectors (d_k = 64)" style="--var-color: #79c0ff">d<sub>k</sub></span>, the
    dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small
    gradients. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1/<span class="var" data-var="d_k"

        style="--var-color: #ff7b72">h</span> = 8 parallel attention heads. For each of these we use <span class="var"

    dimensionality.</p>

<h3 id="ffn">3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks</h3>

<p>In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected
    feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear
    transformations with a ReLU activation in between.</p>

<p>While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to

        data-desc="Model embedding dimension (d_model = 512)" style="--var-color: #ffd700">d<sub>model</sub></span> =

<h3 id="embeddings">3.4 Embeddings and Softmax</h3>

<p>Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output
    tokens to vectors of dimension <span class="var" data-var="d_model"
        data-desc="Model embedding dimension (d_model = 512)" style="--var-color: #ffd700">d<sub>model</sub></span>. We
    also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted
    next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the
    pre-softmax linear transformation. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by <span class="var"
        data-var="d_model" data-desc="Model embedding dimension (d_model = 512)"
        style="--var-color: #ffd700">√d<sub>model</sub></span>.</p>

<h3 id="positional-encoding">3.5 Positional Encoding</h3>

<p>Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the
    sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the tokens in the sequence. To
    this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks.
    The positional encodings have the same dimension <span class="var" data-var="d_model"
        data-desc="Model embedding dimension (d_model = 512)" style="--var-color: #ffd700">d<sub>model</sub></span> as
    the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. We use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:</p>

    <li>Amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations

<h3 id="training-data">5.1 Training Data and Batching</h3>

<p>We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences
    were encoded using byte-pair encoding, which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For
    English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and
    split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence
    length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000
    target tokens.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">5.2 Hardware and Schedule</h3>

<p>We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described
    throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000
    steps or 12 hours. For our big models, step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5
    days).</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">7 Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention,
    replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed
    self-attention.<sup class="ref-badge" data-ref="1" data-title="Attention Is All You Need"
        data-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762"
        data-quote="We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms.">1</sup>
</p>

<p>For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or
    convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we
    achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported
    ensembles.</p>

<p>We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend
    the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local,
    restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video.
    Making generation less sequential is another research goal of ours.</p>
