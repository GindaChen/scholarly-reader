  An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine translation (NMT)
  by
  selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during translation. However,
  there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based
  NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional
  mechanism: a {\it global} approach which always attends to all source words and
  a {\it local} one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. 
  We demonstrate the e
