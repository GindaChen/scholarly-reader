  Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine
      translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the
      neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that
      can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models
      proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family
      of encoder--decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length
      vector from which a decoder generates a tra
