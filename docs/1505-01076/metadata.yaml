abstract: |-
  Big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the
  lightest nuclides via a dynamic
  interplay among the four fundamental forces during
  the first seconds of cosmic time.
  We briefly overview the essentials of this physics,
  and present new calculations of light element abundances
  through \li6 and \li7, with updated nuclear reactions
  and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime.
  We provide fits to these results as a function of baryon density and of
  the number of neutrino fla
