  We present a novel neural network for processing sequences. The ByteNet is a one-dimensional
  convolutional neural network that is composed of two parts, one to encode the source sequence and
  the other to decode the target sequence. The two network parts are connected by stacking the
  decoder on top of the encoder and preserving the temporal resolution of the sequences. To address
  the differing lengths of the source and the target, we introduce an efficient mechanism by which
  the decoder is dynami
