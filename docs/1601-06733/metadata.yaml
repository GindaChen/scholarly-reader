  In this paper we address the question of how to render
            sequence-level networks better at handling structured input.
            We propose a machine reading simulator which processes text
            incrementally from left to right and performs shallow
            reasoning with memory and attention. The reader extends the
            Long Short-Term Memory architecture with a memory network in
            place of a single memory cell. This enables adaptive memory
            usage during recurr
