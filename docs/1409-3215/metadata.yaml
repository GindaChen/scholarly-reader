  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved
  excellent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work
  well whenever large labeled training sets are available, 
  they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences.  In this paper, we
  present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes
  minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a
  multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence
  to a vector of a fixed dimensio
