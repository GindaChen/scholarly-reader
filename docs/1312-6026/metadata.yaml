  In this paper, we explore different ways to extend a recurrent
      neural network (RNN) to a \textit{deep} RNN. We start by
      arguing that the concept of depth in an RNN is not as clear
      as it is in feedforward neural networks.  By carefully
      analyzing and understanding the architecture of an RNN,
      however, we find three points of an RNN which may be made
      deeper; (1) input-to-hidden function, (2) hidden-to-hidden
      transition and (3) hidden-to-output function. Based on this
