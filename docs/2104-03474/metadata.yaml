  Recent progress in language modeling has been driven not only by advances in neural architectures,
  but also through hardware and optimization improvements. In this paper, we revisit the neural
  probabilistic language model (NPLM) of~\citet{Bengio2003ANP}, which simply concatenates word
  embeddings within a fixed window and passes the result through a feed-forward network to predict
  the next word. When scaled up to modern hardware, this model (despite its many limitations)
  performs much better than
