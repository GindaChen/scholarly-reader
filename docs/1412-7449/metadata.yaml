  Syntactic constituency parsing is a fundamental problem in natural
  language processing and has been the subject of intensive research
  and engineering for decades.  As a result, the most accurate parsers
  are domain specific, complex, and inefficient.  In this paper we show
  that the domain agnostic attention-enhanced sequence-to-sequence model
  achieves state-of-the-art results on the most widely used syntactic
  constituency parsing dataset, when trained on a large synthetic
  corpus that was annotate
