  Attentional, RNN-based encoder-decoder models for abstractive summarization have achieved good
  performance on short input and output sequences. For longer documents and summaries however these
  models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases. We introduce a neural network model with a
  novel intra-attention that attends over the input and continuously generated output separately,
  and a new training method that combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement
  learning (RL).
